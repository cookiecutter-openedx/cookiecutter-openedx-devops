# This file will drive the x-blocks and requirements customization
# as described in https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/configuration.html#installing-extra-xblocks-and-requirements
# It will be placed on the location tutor expect is during the CI build.
# If it uses a local private repo it will need to also be checked out in the CI worflow.

# Add your additional requirements, such as xblocks, to this file. For
# requirements coming from private repositories, clone the repository to this
# folder and then add your requirement with the `-e` flag. Ex:
#
#   git clone git@myserver:myprivaterepo.git
#   echo "-e ./myprivaterepo/" >> private.txt
